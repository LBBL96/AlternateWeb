          <p>“There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.” — Mark Twain</p>
          </center>
          <p>Good data analysis requires good data. Sometimes data looks good but has underlying problems that take a little time to tease out. We found a dataset of 10,000 fast food restaurants graciously provided for free by Datafiniti’s Business Database. It contains a wealth of information in each row, including the restaurant’s address and website. At first blush, it felt robust—10,000 rows is a lot of data. Quick sorting showed that California and Texas had the most restaurants, as we expected. Furthermore, grouping by region showed that the restaurants we had in the dataset closely mirrored the overall U.S. population.</p>

          <p>But a second sort grouped by state made it clear that we had a problem. The top 10 states look good at first, but then you’ll notice that New York is ninth in number of restaurants. That doesn’t seem right.</p>

              </center>
              <br>
<br>
              <p>The problem becomes more obvious when you look at the bottom 10 states. Alabama, the nation’s 24th most-populous state, comes in last in number of restaurants. This makes no sense.</P>

                  <br>
                  <br>
          <P>So what’s going on here? Further research showed that the United States has about 241,000 total fast food restaurants, which means that this dataset represents only 4% of all fast food restaurants. We don’t know how these 10,000 were selected from the overall dataset, but they’re clearly not proportional to fast food restaurants overall. Aside from the obvious state population discrepancy, the frequency of restaurants in the smaller dataset is different from the true frequency of particular chains.</P>

              <br>
              <p> Subway, the number-one restaurant by locations in the United States, is third in our dataset. Taco Bell is sixth in actual locations, but second in our dataset. And where is Starbucks, the restaurant chain with the fourth-most locations in the U.S.? We’ll get to that in a minute.
<p> Now is a good time to review the fun facts. Every one of these facts is true based on the given data, but their actual truth is questionable. You might have noticed that most of the graphs are shown as proportions. Proportions can make it easier to hide the flaws in a dataset. Thus we’ll talk about actual counts.</p></p>
